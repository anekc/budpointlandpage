The new year brings new opportunities to improve your finances. Here are 5 practical strategies you can implement today.

## 1. Know exactly where your money goes

The first step to saving is understanding what you spend on. Many people are surprised when they see their expenses categorized.

**Action:** For one week, track absolutely everything you spend. Use an app like Budpoint to make it easy.

## 2. Implement the 50/30/20 rule

This simple rule helps you distribute your income:

| Category | Percentage | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Needs | 50% | Rent, utilities, basic food |
| Wants | 30% | Entertainment, restaurants, hobbies |
| Savings | 20% | Emergency fund, investments |

## 3. Automate your savings

Don't wait to "see what's left" at the end of the month. Set up automatic transfers to your savings account on the same day you receive your paycheck.

> "Pay your future self first"

## 4. Distinguish between your expenses and others'

When someone asks you to buy something for them, that money shouldn't count as your expense. It's a temporary loan they should pay back.

With Budpoint you can:
- Mark who owes you
- See how much you've really spent on yourself
- Keep your budgets accurate

## 5. Review and adjust monthly

Your finances aren't static. Dedicate 15 minutes a month to:

1. Review your progress vs. your goals
2. Identify unnecessary expenses
3. Adjust budgets as needed
