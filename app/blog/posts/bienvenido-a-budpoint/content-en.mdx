We're excited to launch the official **Budpoint** blog, where we'll share tips, guides, and news about personal finance.

## Why we created Budpoint

In a world where shared finances are increasingly common, we noticed that existing apps didn't solve a fundamental problem: **separating your personal expenses from shared expenses**.

When your friend asks you to buy something for them, that expense shouldn't affect your personal budget. Budpoint understands this.

## What's coming

In this blog you'll find:

- **Practical tips** to improve your finances
- **Guides** on how to get the most out of Budpoint
- **News** about app updates
- **Stories** from users who have transformed their relationship with money

## Join the waitlist

Budpoint is coming soon to iOS. If you want to be one of the first to try it, [join our waitlist](/#waitlist).
